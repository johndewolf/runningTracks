# runningTracks

This application was made to help you generate the perfect playlist for your training run. For each mile, select the duration of the mile, the tempo of the music, and the music genre you wish you to run to. After the playlist is created you'll be able to stream it directly from the app or import it into your Spotify account.

This is hosted at [https://runningtracks.herokuapp.com](https://runningtracks.herokuapp.com)

This will built using React / Redux, Meteor.js, and the Spotify API.
